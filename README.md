# notARobin Android (working title Tesla's Pigeon)

To make this work you need to run https://github.com/MatthiasPilz/teslaPigeon and point this Android app to the correct url using `webView.loadUrl(...)` in MainActivity.java.

(Note of caution - https://github.com/MatthiasPilz/teslaPigeon will not deploy on Heroku as Tensorflow is too big)
